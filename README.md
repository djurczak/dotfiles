.dotfiles
========

The basic set of .dotfiles I use for my work as data analyst at the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology (IBMA) in Vienna.

I am not using many vim plugins mainly because I try to stay as close to vanilla configuration as possible. Most of the ideas were taken from various other repositories (and thoughtbot).
